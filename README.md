# Analyzing-Ebay-Car-Sales
This is an exploratory data analysis of some car listing data scraped from ebay.

This is a guided project on dataquest where I worked on a dataset of used cars data from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classified section of the German eBay website.

Some changes were made to the dataset only 50000 data points were taken from the original dataset in order to reduce run time.
The some errors were also added to the dataset in order to create tasks to do.
